# [Project: Analyzing a distribution network](https://github.com/janS95/analyzing_a_distribution_network)

* Read network data from a distribution network in the USA
* Node attributes: Population, Location (Latitude, Longitude)
* Edge weight: Travelling Cost for this connection
* Plot the graph diagram corresponding to location
* Highlight NYC and LA for better orientation
* Use Population (Node Size) and Travelling Cost (Edges width) for styling
* Red Edges: Travelling Cost greater than 770 $

# [Project: Predictions on E-Mail network](https://github.com/janS95/predictions_on_email_network)

* Read E-Mail network dataset
* Node attributes: Department, Management Salary
* Generated Features for predicting if employee has management salary
* Used Random Forest Classifier
* AUC-Score: 0.948
* Generated features for predicting future connections between employees
* AUC-Score: 0.901

* TODO: Optimize features, optimize classifier, try other classifiers, gridsearch
